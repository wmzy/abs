<span class="EDITOR">Edited by Peter Denning</span>, _Computers Under Attack: Intruders, Worms, and Viruses_, ACM Press, 1990, 0-201-53067-8.

This compendium contains a couple of articles on shell script viruses.

*

<span class="AUTHOR">Ken Burtch</span>, _Linux Shell Scripting with Bash_, 1st edition, Sams Publishing (Pearson), 2004, 0672326426.

Covers much of the same material as this guide. Dead tree media does have its advantages, though.

<span class="AUTHOR">Dale Dougherty</span> <span class="AUTHOR">and Arnold Robbins</span>, _Sed and Awk_, 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 1997, 1-156592-225-5.

To unfold the full power of shell scripting, you need at least a passing familiarity with **sed** and **awk**. This is the standard tutorial. It includes an excellent introduction to <span class="QUOTE">"regular expressions"</span>. Read this book.

*

<span class="AUTHOR">Jeffrey Friedl</span>, _Mastering Regular Expressions_, O'Reilly and Associates, 2002, 0-596-00289-0.

The best, all-around reference on [Regular Expressions](regexp.md#REGEXREF).

*

<span class="AUTHOR">Aeleen Frisch</span>, _Essential System Administration_, 3rd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 2002, 0-596-00343-9.

This excellent sys admin manual has a decent introduction to shell scripting for sys administrators and does a nice job of explaining the startup and initialization scripts. The long overdue third edition of this classic has finally been released.

*

<span class="AUTHOR">Neil Matthew</span> <span class="AUTHOR">and Richard Stones</span>, _Beginning Linux Programming_, Wrox Press, 1996, 1874416680.

Good in-depth coverage of various programming languages available for Linux, including a fairly strong chapter on shell scripting.

*

<span class="AUTHOR">Herbert Mayer</span>, _Advanced C Programming on the IBM PC_, Windcrest Books, 1989, 0830693637.

<span class="AUTHOR">Cameron Newham</span> <span class="AUTHOR">and Bill Rosenblatt</span>, _Learning the Bash Shell_, 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 1998, 1-56592-347-2.

This is a valiant effort at a decent shell primer, but somewhat deficient in coverage on programming topics and lacking sufficient examples.

*

<span class="AUTHOR">Anatole Olczak</span>, _Bourne Shell Quick Reference Guide_, ASP, Inc., 1991, 093573922X.

A very handy pocket reference, despite lacking coverage of Bash-specific features.

<span class="AUTHOR">Jerry Peek,</span> <span class="AUTHOR">Tim O'Reilly,</span> <span class="AUTHOR">and Mike Loukides</span>, _Unix Power Tools_, 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, Random House, 1997, 1-56592-260-3.

Contains a couple of sections of very informative in-depth articles on shell programming, but falls short of being a tutorial. It reproduces much of the regular expressions tutorial from the Dougherty and Robbins book, above.

*

<span class="AUTHOR">Arnold Robbins</span>, _Bash Reference Card_, SSC, 1998, 1-58731-010-5.

*

<span class="AUTHOR">Arnold Robbins</span>, _Effective Awk Programming_, Free Software Foundation / O'Reilly and Associates, 2000, 1-882114-26-4.

The absolute best **awk** tutorial and reference. The free electronic version of this book is part of the **awk** documentation, and printed copies of the latest version are available from O'Reilly and Associates.

This book has served as an inspiration for the author of this document.
