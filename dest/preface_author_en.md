Greetings to Linux users in the great nation of China!

I hope that the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide will help you learn the intricacies of Linux and appreciate its utility. Time spent writing scripts will reward you in increased understanding of the operating system and appreciation of the power at your fingertips.

In past eras China was a shining light when much of the rest of the world lay in darkness. Perhaps a new generation of Chinese computer science scholars can help liberate us from the darkness of the Microsoft monopoly.

The translators of this book deserve a great deal of credit and praise for all the time and effort they have invested in this project. I wish to give special thanks to them.
